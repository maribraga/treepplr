\description{
\code{tp_compile} compile a TreePPL model to use by \link{tp_run}.
}
\details{
\code{model_file_name} : a character vector giving to \link{tp_treeppl} as
a model name.  Use a \link{tp_data_stored} name if you have already
write your model with \link{tp_treeppl}.

\code{seed} : The random seed to use. Using 'NULL' initialized randomly.

\code{method} : Inference method to be used. The selected inference method.
The supported methods are: is-lw, smc-bpf, smc-apf, mcmc-lightweight,
mcmc-trace, mcmc-naive, pmcmc-pimh.

The following options are highly dependable of the method used.
Check [not implemented yet] for more information.

\code{align} : Whether or not to align the model for certain inference algorithms.

\code{cps} : Configuration of CPS transformation (only applicable to certain
inference algorithms). The supported options are: none, partial, and full.

\code{delay} : The model is transformed to an efficient representation if
possible. The supported options are: static or dynamic. Use 'NULL' to ignore.

\code{kernel} : The value of the driftScale for driftKernel in MCMC. Use 'NULL'
to ignore. Use in conjuction with \code{method} mcmc-lightweight".
Use 'NULL' to ignore

\code{mcmc_lw_gprob} : The probability of performing a global MH step
(non-global means only modify a single sample in the previous trace).
Use in conjuction with \code{method} mcmc-lightweight". Use 'NULL' to ignore

\code{pmcmc_particles} : The number of particles for the smc proposal computation.
This option is used if one of the following methods are used: pmcmc-*.
Use 'NULL' to ignore

\code{prune} : The model is pruned if possible.

\code{subsample} : The number of draw to subsample from the posterior
distribution. Use in conjuction with \code{method} smc-apf or smc-bpf.
Use 'NULL' to ignore.

\code{resample}: The selected resample placement method, for inference algorithms
where applicable. The supported methods are:
likelihood (resample immediately after all likelihood updates),
align (resample after aligned likelihood updates, forces --align),
and manual (sample only at manually defined resampling locations).
Use 'NULL' to ignore.
